                    <h1>Edward Torres</h1>
                    <h2>Information Technology Expert</h2>

                    <p>Hello! Welcome to my webpage!<br> I'm a student majoring in computer information systems, data analytics, and business administration. I used to work as a field support technician for a managed service provider called CompuCom. I fixed computers, laptops, registers, laser printers, servers, and networking issues for many large companies all over Southern California such as Wal-Mart, Target, Home Depot, Wells Fargo, AllState, and many more! However, technology advances rapidly and that is why I am currently attending college in order to upgrade my skills. I'm working hard in college to master all the new technologies in business such as cloud computing, cyber security, data analytics, databases, and web developtment!  </p>
                    <!-- e.g. I love building websites, and learning to code! -->
                    <p>My Hobbies: <br>
                     I enjoy mountain biking and hiking, family barbecues at the park, playing chess online, watching YouTube documentaries from amateur historians, and listening to classical, jazz, rock, and electronic music. </p>
                    <!-- e.g. I spent my weekends in the mountains hiking with my friends. -->

                        <h3>Current Project - Web Application</h3>
                        <p>My goal in this project is to build a simple LAMP stack web app such as an employee/inventory directory or a customer database. The purpose of this project is to test my knowledge of HTTP, CSS, Javascript, Linux servers, networking, SQL, and Python programming. Once completed, I will then migrate the app to AWS to test my knowledge of cloud computing.    </p>

                        <h3>Past Project - Data Mining Amazon.com Reviews </h3>
                        <p>In this project I data mined hundreds of amazon reviews for a bag of parakeet birdseed that had 4.5 out of 5 stars. The purpose was to quickly determine the most common reasons behind each customer's review and why they chose to give the amound of stars they did to this product. This project involved the use of jupyter notebooks, beautiful soup, word cloud, and python programming to webscrape reviews off of the product's page on amazon.com. Statistics were performed to determine the spread of star scores among all customers. Reviews were grouped by star score and analyzed to find the top words used by each review group. Wordcloud was used to visually display these words in order to easily intrepret the most common reasons this product received the stars score given. </p>

                        <h3>Past Project - AWS Cloud Networking </h3>
                        <p>In this project I created a virtual network on Amazon Web Services. I created three Virtual Private Clouds with their own EC2 instances that were able to communicate with each other with public IP addresses over Internet Gateways and with private IP addresses through Transit Gateways that I configured. I then expanded the network by using CloudFormation to add a stack containing a website server, DNS server, and bastion server. I configured the bastion server to act as a VPN gateway for this stack. I setup a VPN Tunnnel and Route53 to resolve DNS requests for the test website. I then setup network monitoring using CloudWatch, configured a VPN down alarm, configured ACL lists, configured Security Groups, and managed permissions for S3 buckets used by EC2 instances inside my network.  </p>
